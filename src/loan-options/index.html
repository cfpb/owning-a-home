        <h1>Understanding loan options</h1>

        <p class="lead">The kind of mortgage you choose has a big impact on how much you end up paying&mdash;how much you’ll have to pay upfront, your monthly payment amount, and the total cost of your loan over time. It also affects the level of risk you take on. Knowing what kind of loan is most appropriate for your situation prepares you for talking to lenders and getting the best deal.</p>

                          <p>Shorter terms will generally save you money overall, but have higher monthly payments. There are two reasons shorter terms can save you money:  </p>

                          <ol>
                            <li>You are borrowing money and paying interest for a shorter amount of <strong>time</strong>.</li>
                            <li>The <strong>interest rate</strong> is usually lower&mdash;by as much as a full percentage point.</li>
                          </ol>

                          <p>Rates vary among lenders, especially for shorter terms. Always compare official loan offers, called <a href="/askcfpb/146/what-is-a-good-faith-estimate-what-is-a-gfe.html" id="good-faith-link">Good Faith Estimates</a>, before making your decision.</p>

                          <p>Your monthly payments are more likely to be stable with a fixed-rate loan, so you might prefer this option if you value certainty about your loan costs over the long term. With a fixed-rate loan, your interest rate and monthly <a href="/askcfpb/1941/on-a-mortgage-whats-the-difference-between-my-principal-and-interest-payment-and-my-total-monthly-payment.html">principal and interest payment</a> will stay the same. Your <a href="/askcfpb/1941/on-a-mortgage-whats-the-difference-between-my-principal-and-interest-payment-and-my-total-monthly-payment.html">total monthly payment</a> can still change—for example, if your property taxes, homeowner’s insurance, or mortgage insurance might go up or down.</p>

                          <p>Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer less predictability but may be cheaper in the short term. You may want to consider this option if, for example, you plan to move again within the initial fixed period of an ARM. In this case, future rate adjustments may not affect you. However, if you end up staying in your house longer than expected, you may end up paying a lot more. In the later years of an ARM, your interest rate <a href="/askcfpb/1949/for-an-adjustable-rate-mortgage-arm-what-are-the-index-and-margin-and-how-do-they-work.html">changes based on the market</a>, and your monthly principal and interest payment <a href="/askcfpb/1965/how-do-mortgage-lenders-calculate-monthly-payments.html">could go up a lot</a>, even double. <a href="/askcfpb/1947/if-i-am-considering-an-adjustable-rate-mortgage-arm-what-should-i-look-out-for-in-the-fine-print.html">Learn more</a>.</p>

                    <p>Most ARMs have two periods. During the first period, your interest rate is fixed and won’t change. During the second period, your rate goes up and down regularly based on market changes. <a href="/askcfpb/1949/for-an-adjustable-rate-mortgage-arm-what-are-the-index-and-margin-and-how-do-they-work.html">Learn more</a> about how adjustable rates change.
