            <p>Many states, local governments, and nonprofits offer programs to make homeownership more affordable. Many of these programs focus on <strong>low- and moderate-income</strong> families buying their first home, though some may be available to families who have previously owned a home. Other programs target teachers, firefighters, and other public service employees, or people interested in purchasing a home in a particular neighborhood. </p>

            <p>Many programs offer down payment assistance that can be used with a regular <a href="/loan-types/FHA-loans/">FHA</a> or conventional loan. Some programs lend money directly through subsidized loans. </p>

            <p>If you think you might qualify, explore programs in your area using <a class="external-link" href="http://downpaymentresource.com/">this tool</a> or contact a <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/find-a-housing-counselor/" id="hud-link">local housing counselor</a> to discuss your options.

          <h3>Mortgage Insurance: What you need to know</h3>

          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance helps you get a loan you wouldn’t otherwise be able to.</strong> If you can’t afford a 20 percent down payment, you will likely have to pay for mortgage insurance. You may choose to get a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance (PMI), or an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance usually adds to your costs.</strong> Depending on the loan type, you will pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums, an upfront mortgage insurance fee, or both.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments. It does not protect you.</strong> Your credit score will suffer and you may face foreclosure if you don’t pay your mortgage on time.</p>
