          <p>“Conventional” just means that the loan is not part of a specific government program. Conventional loans typically cost less than <a href=a href="/loan-options/FHA-loans/">FHA loans</a> but can be more difficult to get. There are two main categories of conventional loans:</p>
          <p><strong>Conforming loans</strong> have maximum loan amounts that are set by the government. Other rules for conforming loans are set by <a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/askcfpb/1959/what-are-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac.html">Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac</a>, companies that provide backing for conforming loans.</p>
          <p><strong>Non-conforming loans</strong> are less standardized. Eligibility, pricing, and features can vary widely by lender, so it’s particularly important to shop around and compare several offers. </p>

          <h3>Mortgage Insurance: What you need to know</h3>

          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance helps you get a loan you wouldn’t otherwise be able to.</strong> If you can’t afford a 20 percent down payment, you will likely have to pay for mortgage insurance. You may choose to get a conventional loan with private mortgage insurance (PMI), or an FHA, VA, or USDA loan.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance usually adds to your costs.</strong> Depending on the loan type, you will pay monthly mortgage insurance premiums, an upfront mortgage insurance fee, or both. Make sure to look at the total cost of interest rate, mortgage insurance, and fees.</p>
          <p><strong>Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you fall behind on your payments. It does not protect you.</strong> Your credit score will suffer and you may face foreclosure if you don’t pay your mortgage on time. </p>
